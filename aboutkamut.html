		<h2>About Kamut</h2>
		<p>Kamut® is a trademarked brand name for a specific type of ancient wheat known as Khorasan wheat. The trademark ensures that products labeled as Kamut® meet specific standards set by the Kamut International organization, including guidelines for cultivation, processing, and marketing.

            Here are some key features and characteristics of Kamut®:
            
            1. **Origin**: Kamut® wheat is believed to have originated in the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle East thousands of years ago. It is an ancient grain that has been cultivated for centuries, but its cultivation declined over time as modern wheat varieties became more dominant.
            
            2. **Botanical Characteristics**: Kamut® wheat is a type of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum) with large kernels that are elongated and amber in color. It has a rich, nutty flavor and a chewy texture.
            
            3. **Nutritional Profile**: Kamut® wheat is known for its nutritional benefits. It is high in protein, fiber, vitamins (especially B vitamins), and minerals (such as selenium, magnesium, and zinc). Some people find that they tolerate Kamut® better than modern wheat varieties, although it still contains gluten and is not suitable for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivities.
            
            4. **Culinary Uses**: Kamut® wheat can be used in various culinary applications, similar to other wheat varieties. It can be milled into flour and used to make bread, pasta, noodles, pastries, and other baked goods. Kamut® grains can also be cooked and used in salads, pilafs, soups, and casseroles.
            
            5. **Sustainability**: Kamut® wheat is often grown using organic farming practices and is considered to be more environmentally friendly than conventional wheat farming. It is typically grown in rotation with other crops to promote soil health and reduce the need for chemical inputs.
            
            6. **Certification**: Products labeled as Kamut® must meet specific criteria established by Kamut International, including standards for organic cultivation, minimal processing, and the use of the trademarked name. This helps ensure the authenticity and quality of Kamut® products in the marketplace.
            
            Overall, Kamut® wheat is valued for its unique flavor, nutritional benefits, and potential health advantages for some individuals. While it shares many similarities with other wheat varieties, its distinct characteristics and trademarked status set it apart in the market..</p>
