		<h2>About Corn Flour</h2>
		<p>Corn flour is a fine, powdery flour made from ground corn kernels. It is commonly used in various culinary applications and is a staple ingredient in many cuisines around the world. Corn flour is often confused with cornmeal, but they are different products with distinct textures and uses.

            Here are some key features and uses of corn flour:
            
            1. **Production**: Corn flour is typically made by milling dried corn kernels into a fine powder. The corn kernels may be either yellow or white, depending on the variety of corn used. The milling process removes the bran and germ, resulting in a flour with a smooth texture.
            
            2. **Texture and Appearance**: Corn flour is finely ground and has a soft, powdery texture. It is pale yellow or white in color, depending on the variety of corn used. Compared to cornmeal, which is coarser and grittier, corn flour has a finer consistency.
            
            3. **Gluten-Free**: Corn flour is naturally gluten-free, making it suitable for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivities. It is often used as a substitute for wheat flour in gluten-free baking recipes.
            
            4. **Culinary Uses**: Corn flour is used in a variety of culinary applications, both in savory and sweet dishes. It is commonly used to thicken sauces, gravies, soups, and stews due to its ability to absorb liquid and form a smooth paste when cooked. Corn flour is also used to make cornbread, tortillas, tamales, and other baked goods in many Latin American and Caribbean cuisines. Additionally, it can be used as a coating for frying foods or as a base for breading mixtures.
            
            5. **Cornstarch vs. Corn Flour**: In some regions, particularly in the United Kingdom, the term "corn flour" is used interchangeably with cornstarch, which is a highly refined starch derived from corn. However, in other parts of the world, including the United States, corn flour refers specifically to the finely ground powder made from whole corn kernels. Cornstarch is often used as a thickening agent in cooking and baking, while corn flour has a broader range of culinary uses.
            
            Overall, corn flour is a versatile ingredient with a wide range of culinary uses, prized for its smooth texture, neutral flavor, and gluten-free properties. It adds depth and texture to dishes and is an essential ingredient in many traditional recipes..</p>
