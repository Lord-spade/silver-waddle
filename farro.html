		<h2>About Farro Grain</h2>
		<p>Farro is an ancient grain that has been cultivated for thousands of years and is still popular in many parts of the world today. It is an ancient wheat variety, specifically from the species Triticum dicoccum, although it's sometimes also used to refer to other related wheat species like Triticum monococcum or Triticum spelta. Farro has a nutty flavor and a chewy texture, similar to barley or brown rice.

            Farro is commonly used in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines, particularly in Italy, where it has been a staple food for centuries. It can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, salads, pilafs, risottos, and even desserts.
            
            There are three main types of farro:
            
            1. **Pearled Farro**: This type has had its outer husk removed and has been partially polished, resulting in a quicker cooking time compared to whole farro. However, some of the bran and germ have also been removed during this process, so it's slightly less nutritious than whole farro.
            
            2. **Semi-Pearled Farro**: Semi-pearled farro has had some of the outer husk removed but retains more of the bran and germ compared to pearled farro. It cooks faster than whole farro but retains more of its nutritional value.
            
            3. **Whole Farro**: Whole farro is the least processed type, with the entire grain left intact, including the bran, germ, and endosperm. It takes longer to cook compared to pearled or semi-pearled farro but retains the most nutrients and fiber.
            
            Nutritionally, farro is high in protein, fiber, vitamins (such as B vitamins), and minerals (such as iron, magnesium, and zinc). It's also a good source of complex carbohydrates, making it a nutritious and filling option for meals. Additionally, farro is often favored by people with gluten sensitivities or intolerances because it contains less gluten than modern wheat varieties, although it's not entirely gluten-free and should be avoided by those with celiac disease..</p>
