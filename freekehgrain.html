		<h2>About freekeh</h2>
		<p>Freekeh, also spelled frikeh, farik, or freekah, is an ancient grain that is popular in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is made from green durum wheat that has been harvested while still young, then roasted and threshed to remove the chaff. The name "freekeh" comes from the Arabic word "faraka," which means "to rub," referring to the process of rubbing or threshing the wheat to remove the chaff.

            During the roasting process, the green wheat is often set on fire, which burns the chaff and imparts a smoky flavor to the grain. This roasting process also gives freekeh its characteristic green color. After roasting, the wheat is then further processed to remove any remaining chaff and sorted into different grades.
            
            Freekeh has a unique flavor that is nutty, earthy, and slightly smoky, with a chewy texture similar to other whole grains like barley or farro. It can be used in a variety of dishes, including pilafs, salads, soups, and side dishes, and it's often cooked similarly to rice or other grains.
            
            Nutritionally, freekeh is similar to other whole grains, offering a good source of fiber, protein, vitamins (such as B vitamins), and minerals (such as iron, magnesium, and zinc). It is also low in fat and has a low glycemic index, which means it can help regulate blood sugar levels. Additionally, freekeh contains prebiotics, which can support gut health by feeding beneficial bacteria in the digestive system.
            
            Overall, freekeh is valued not only for its nutritional content but also for its unique flavor and versatility in cooking, making it a popular ingredient in many cuisines around the world..</p>
